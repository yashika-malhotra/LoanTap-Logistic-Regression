## üìö About Data


## üéØ Objective
The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?
How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands

## MicroMobility Service Provider Data: Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization
Data Analysis and Visualization on Walmart Data to provide insights and recommendations to improve their userbase.

Column | Description | 
|:--------|:------------|
|datetime| datetime |  
|season| season (1: spring, 2: summer, 3: fall, 4: winter)|
|holiday| whether day is a holiday or not (extracted from http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule)|
|workingday| if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.|
|temp| temperature in Celsius|
|atemp| feeling temperature in Celsius|
|humidity| humidity|
|windspeed| wind speed|
|casual| count of casual users|
|registered| count of registered users|
|count - Total_riders| count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered|

- weather

|Category|Details|
|:------|:--------|
|1| Clear, Few clouds, partly cloudy, partly cloudy|
|2| Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist|
|3| Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds|

## Performed following Tasks
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Visualization
4. Hypothesis Testing
   
- Observations on the shape of data, data types of all the attributes, conversion of categorical attributes to 'category', missing value detection, statistical summary

- Non-Graphical Analysis: Value counts and unique attributes ‚Äã
- Visual Analysis after pre-processing of the data -
  * Univariate (distribution plots of all the continuous variable(s) barplots/countplots of all the categorical variables),
  * Bivariate (Relationships between important variables such as workday and count, season and count, weather and count)
    
- For continuous variable(s): Distplot, countplot, histogram for univariate analysis 
- For categorical variable(s): Boxplot 
- For correlation: Heatmaps, Pairplots 
- Missing Value & Outlier check

- Explored relation between the dependent and independent variable (Dependent ‚ÄúCount‚Äù & Independent: Workingday, Weather, Season etc)
- Performed approriate testing on all of the below mentioned questions: 
  * Working Day has effect on number of electric cycles rented
  * No. of cycles rented similar or different in different seasons
  * No. of cycles rented similar or different in different weather
  * Weather is dependent on season (check between 2 predictor variable)

- Performed Hypothesis Testing: 
  * Set up Null Hypothesis (H0)
  * State the alternate hypothesis (H1)
  * 2- Sample T-Test to check if Working Day has an effect on the number of electric cycles rented 
  * ANNOVA to check if No. of cycles rented is similar or different in different 1. weather 2. season 
  * Chi-square test to check if Weather is dependent on the season

- Checked assumptions of the test (Normality, Equal Variance) using Histogram, Q-Q plot or statistical methods like levene‚Äôs test, Shapiro-wilk test 
- Calculate test Statistics

- Insights - based on EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 
  * Visual analysis 
  * Hypothesis formulation 
  * Selection of the appropriate test 
  * Checked test assumptions 
  * Find the p-value
  * Conclusion based on the p-value 

- Business Insights & Recommendations : Includes patterns observed in the data along with what can infer from it.
